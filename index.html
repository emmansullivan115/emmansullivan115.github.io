            <p>I'm a junior journalism student at the University of Florida, but to define myself as merely an academic doesn't quite do me justice. I am a passionate and creative individual who looks at the world a bit differently than most.</p>

<p>On any given day, you can find me painting, building my company, booking flights across the country (or globe for that matter), and perhaps, most importantly, interacting with the world one moment at a time in the most positive ways I can. </p>

<p>From neuroscience research to nonprofit work, I have immersed myself in a little bit of everything in Gainesville, FL. I am a life long learner fascinated with the power of everyday people to change to world.</p>

            <p>I spend time every day making sure my mind, body and soul are adequately nourished. I meditate, excercise, read extensively and cook (or at least try to). I have a serious addiction to all things related to pizza, the beach, animals and music.</p>
            
<p>Day-in and day-out, I fuse my passion for the arts and sciences with my hobbies of journalism, entrepreneurship and philanthropy.</p>

<p>You are cordially invited to use this website as an introduction to my skill sets, goals, interests and wonderful life experiences. <strong>Enjoy!</strong></p>
