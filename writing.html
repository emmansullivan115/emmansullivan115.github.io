            <h4><a href="http://gainesvillescene.com/2013/02/21/fragile-human-glass/" target="_blank">FRAGILE: Human Glass
</a></h4>
            <p>"...as humans hurtling through a technological world, we owe it to ourselves to ask these questions, ponder about the implications, and simply think before we rush out to the store to buy the latest gadget."</p>
            
            <h2>Music</h2>
            <img src="img/csn.jpg" width=70% alt="CSN" title="Via: http://www.lehighvalleylive.com/blogs/"/><br>
            <h4><a href="http://collegefuse.com/2013/06/an-ageless-night-with-csn/" target="_blank">An Ageless Night with Crosby, Stills, and Nash
</a></h4>
            <p>"The group masters aspects of music that I find many musicians today do not. They effortlessly transition from instrument-heavy rock songs with complex musicality to soft acoustic love songs to acapella harmonies that induce tears in every audience member regardless of their age."</p>
            
            <h2>Social Issues</h2>
             <img src="img/homeless.jpg" width=70% alt="homeless" title="Via: http://www.humansofnewyork.com/"/><br>
            <h4><a href="http://gainesvillescene.com/2013/03/22/midtown-and-a-question-of-morality/" target="_blank">Midtown And A Question Of Morality</a></h4>
            <p>"We look at them as if poverty is a plague and it has taken them as their victims and we look away and walk past pretending they aren’t there so we do not infect ourselves. So we are not overcome by the sickness of having nothing."</p>
            
             <h2>Personal Growth</h2>
            <img src="img/thinker.jpg" width=70% alt="TheThinker" title="Via: http://www.visitphilly.com/music-art/philadelphia/the-thinker/"/><br>
            <h4><a href="http://gainesvillescene.com/2013/07/22/what-makes-you-human/" target="_blank">Harder, Better, Faster</a></h4>
            <p>"As college students, think of how much of your time energy and effort is dedicated to making sure your body matches the standards of our society, making sure your clothes help you fall into the social bracket that you want, making sure your hair and make up are always looking better and better. Could you possibly compare the number of hours spent in the gym to the number of hours you spent working on your true self?"</p>
            
            <h2>Art & Entertainment</h2>

            <h4><a href="http://gainesvillescene.com/2013/07/23/intouchable-art-a-foreign-concept/" target="_blank">Intouchable Art, a Foreign Concept</a></h4>
            <p>"To watch a movie produced by minds that absorb a culture very different than your own every day of their lives, is to broaden your insight of our species. It gives you the chance to see what others value, what makes them laugh and what tragedies of this life cause them to struggle."</p>
            
            <h2>Culture</h2>
             <img src="img/blurred.jpg" width=80% alt="BlurredLines" title="BlurredLines"/>
                                                                            
<h4><a href="http://gainesvillescene.com/2013/09/04/blurred-lines-defined-women/" target="_blank">Blurred Lines, Defined Women</a></h4>
            <p>"Right now, as a 20-something, it’s crucial to form your own identity as a woman—hopefully a strong and independent one— in the college setting, because the idea of women being objectified is unlikely to disappear, regardless of how many parodies are made of misogynistic music videos."</p>
            
            <h2>Profile</h2>
                <img src="img/david.jpg" width=70% alt="GoogleGlass" title="Via: http://www.google.com/glass/start/what-it"/><br>
               <h4><a href="http://gainesvillescene.com/2013/10/02/passion-balance-and-the-pursuit-of-juggling/" target="_blank">Passion, Balance and the Pursuit of Juggling</a></h4>

            <p>"David pulls himself from the captivating memories of his past successes and sighs. Students rush through the HUB without noticing him and he blends in with everyone else. He has settled into the normal routine of a college student and finds juggling school and well, practicing juggling to be difficult."</p>
